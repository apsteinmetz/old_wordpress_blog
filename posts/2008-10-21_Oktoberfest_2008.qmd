And, yes, it was my 50th Birthday party, but let's not dwell on that. Yes, I did get drunk in front of my boss but let's not dwell on that either.  We found a caterer who cooked the traditional Bavarian specialties and an oom-pah band.  I put on my Dad's old Lederhosen and Carrie really rocked her Dirndl.  My friends and co-workers really got into the spirit. The enormous boobs many women, and some men, are sporting are a function of the novelty vests we got for those who didn't have "echte Trachten." Amazing fun. I think we'll do it again next year.
