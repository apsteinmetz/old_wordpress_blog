<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;" align="center">The Night Before the Steinmetz 2008 Christmas</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;" align="center">(with huge apologies to Clement Clarke Moore)</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">'Twas the day before Christmas, when all through the farm</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">All the creatures were stirring, with great cause for alarm;</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">The stockings were barely hung by the chimney in time,</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">As the days were too quickly approaching two-thousand and nine;</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">The children were hyped up on holiday treats,</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">While only visions of bedtime left empty sheets;</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Ma-ma busily wrapping in the craft room, and Art last-minute shopping at Drug Fair,</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Were hurrying to avoid a Christmas nightmare,</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Later that day on the lawn there arose such a clatter,</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">As the family wrestled with garland, lights and a leftover construction ladder;</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">The candles in the windows were placed in a jiffy,</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Then the tree was brought in â€“ would it be decorated by Christmas? It was iffy.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Now Art insisted on getting into the Christmas spirit and hanging a wreath,</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Risking his neck and ours as we all stood in the snow beneath,</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">He threw down the line, then turned with a jerk,</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Whistling and shouting, and putting us to work;</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">"Now, Jakob! now, Nathan! now, Austin and Carrie!</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Now, Maxfield, now Ryan! Hurry up! Come on now, hurry!</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">To the top of the porch! to the top of the wall!</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Now hoist away! Hoist away! Hoist away all!"</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">And then, in a twinkling, everything was all set,</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">The night before Christmas was upon us as we sipped some hot chocolate,</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">We realized we had found true holiday spirit in working together as we looked around,</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">And, we enjoyed some peace on earth with each other before morning, when all the children came down with a bound.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Their eyes -- how they twinkled! They were awestruck!</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Santaâ€™s spirit had come despite crying and pouting â€“ what luck!</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Gifts (and re-gifts) of love were torn open with the force of a bomb</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Slowing down now to send our friends and family hugs and kisses,</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">We hope you enjoyed your Chanukah, Kwanzaa, Winter Solstice and/or Christmas,</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">We hope you and yours were able to enjoy some holiday cheer,</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">And we look forward to seeing you in a Happy New Year.</p>
