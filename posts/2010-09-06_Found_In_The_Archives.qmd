Back in the spring of 1980, a cocksure frat boy wrote the Kappa Sigma newsletter.  It was his senior year and he was in no mood to be serious about the future, preferring to revel in the debauchery of the present.  The newsletter is mostly mundane, but reveals a bit of the zeitgeist, the drunkeness, the casual disrespect of women (borne mainly out of sour grapes, we suspect) and self loathing.  Good fun all around but of little or no interest to anyone but those who were there.
