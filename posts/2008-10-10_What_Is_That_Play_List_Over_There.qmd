title: What Is That Play List Over There?

In our house we use some internet radios that stream from our music in-house and the internet radio stations.  <a href="http://last.fm">last.fm</a>, a music social network, "scrobbles" the names of songs we play and sticks them in my profile and then let's me stick a playlist widget back here.  Many of the songs on the list are playable on demand at last.fm if you click on them.  Wild.

I like looking at songs on people's iPods and books on their shelves so you might too.  It's not a totally narcissistic exercise, I hope.

Do note that the players are usually on random shuffle so forgive me when Christmas music comes around and how-did-that-Olivia-Newton
