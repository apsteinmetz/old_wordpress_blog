It's that time of year again. Oktoberfest! We decided to celebrate it when the Germans do - in September. Go figure. Get ready for more hijinks and embarrassment, all documented with many megapixels, Bollywood style!. We got the local Desi dance troupe to give us some lessons. Also, as you'll see, this was a chance for my team to pound the stuffing out of the boss.
